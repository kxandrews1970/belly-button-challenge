# belly-button-challenge14

Purpose is to build an interactive dashboard that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels..oh boy.
The main purpose is exposure to d3.json from a url and making charts with d3.json.  Starting to see elements of pandas in js and how/why we are gradually building off these things.  Only thing is keeping the commands straight. Building it into index.xml and finally publishing on github pages.  Mine is located here https://kxandrews1970.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ So you can view the interactive graphs. It has a dropdown where the user can change items and can see the chart update to the corresponding item.  The code is app.js located in the static\js folder.Double-click the index.html to launch it chrome.

For starting ideas I looked at  https://jeremytallant.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ for when I got stuck and a jumpstart.  All said, I can pick out what the code is doing which is a start and farther than i have gotten with js ever before.  Thank you goes out to Hunter, who explained and showed it better this week (my opinion) as we go deeper in js.  It is all new to most of the class so sinking in takes a bit of time.  TAs popping in on breakout sessions also receives my thanks.
